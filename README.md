LLM with Retrieval‐Augmented Generation (RAG)
Project Summary
This repository demonstrates how to build a Retrieval‐Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) for semantic search and GPT‐2 (or any other LLM) for text generation. By integrating Faiss for vector similarity search, the system retrieves the most relevant context from a custom corpus and then uses that context to produce more accurate, domain‐specific answers.

Key Features
DPR Bi‐Encoder

A Question Encoder transforms user queries into embeddings.
A Context Encoder transforms each chunk of your corpus into embeddings.
This approach allows the system to match queries and documents semantically, rather than relying on exact keyword matches.
Faiss Vector Search

Faiss stores all context embeddings in a highly efficient index.
When a user poses a question, the question embedding is searched against the index to retrieve the top‐k most relevant contexts.
GPT‐2 (LLM) for Generation

The retrieved passages are fed into GPT‐2 alongside the user question to generate a comprehensive, context‐aware answer.
This method reduces “hallucinations” by grounding generation in real textual sources.
t‐SNE Visualization (Optional)

For exploratory purposes, scikit‐learn’s t‐SNE can project high‐dimensional embeddings to 2D/3D, allowing quick inspection of how similar (or different) documents are in the latent space.
